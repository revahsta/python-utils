Some little utility scripts that I have written in Python. Some may be more
useful than others.

word_swap.py
	A Python script that takes a word an makes a given number of other "words"
	by shuffling around the letters in that word. Might be useful for
	something.

random_numbers.py
	A script that gives the numbers in a given range back in a random order.
